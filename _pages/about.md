### Economics, and tech. Techonomics?

My path to my current spot has been unconventional (I enjoy saying that). I started with a degree in Economics, then spent a few years fixing technology and talking to people at Apple. Somewhere along the way, I discovered a genuine interest in how the underlying infrastructure of it all works. 

The connecting principle is really simple: taking complex things apart and putting them back together in a way that makes sense, because the things that come naturally do not interest me. At university, it was economic models. As a technician at Apple _practical_ relationship between users and technology. In both roles, the key was clear communication.

That same curiosity led me to the cloud, automation, and security which the foundational systems that power so much I saw. I enjoy the hands-on challenge of making tools work.

Now, at **Accenture**, I'm looking forward to applying this perspective. I find the problems that exist at the intersection of business strategy and technical execution to be the most interesting ones to solve.
